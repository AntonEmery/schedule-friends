This project is a starter for a full stack web app using Node and React with Postgres as the database.

Node and Postgres are running in Docker, which should hopefully make it easier to get started.

### Prerequisites
Docker Desktop
node
npm


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AntonEmery/web-app-docker-starter
```
